As a part of learning solidity I tried to implement a nft-collectible model, where users can create new collectibles and the other users can buy the collectible. I know there are so many optimisations and mistakes(may be).

My assumptions:
  I considered a collectible to be a name without tokenURI (Just for easy implementation.)
  There is no frontend as I did it in remix ide, So, transfering of ether is not implemented (I couldn't find a way)

This is the modified version of the nft.sol which was in the same repository.

This was just for practice:)
